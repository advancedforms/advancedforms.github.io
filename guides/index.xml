Examples include {field:NAME} and {entry_id}. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s desirable to add custom merge tags which we&amp;rsquo;ll cover in this guide.
Registering a new merge tag To add merge tags we use the af/merge_tags/resolve filter. This filter will be invoked for every merge tag, that is all occurences of two braces ({}) with content in between.</description></item><item><title>Adding custom restrictions</title><link>/guides/adding-custom-restrictions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/adding-custom-restrictions/</guid><description>Advanced Forms comes with the option to hide a form unless certain conditions are meet. Included is the ability to limit the number of entries created by a form, to restrict a form from non-logged in users, and to set a schedule during which the form should be available.
Custom restrictions may be applied using the filter af/form/restriction which is documented here. The following is an example of limiting a form to only administrators.</description></item><item><title>Available arguments</title><link>/guides/available-arguments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/available-arguments/</guid><description>This page lists all the available arguments that may be passed when displaying a form, either using a shortcode or a function call.

The visualization below shows the different HTML elements that make up a form, classes that can be used to style them and hooks that might be useful.
Some customization can be achieved with the form arguments, for example changing the submit button text. If you want to programmatically change the arguments then use the af/form/args filter.</description></item><item><title>Customizing validations</title><link>/guides/customizing-validations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/customizing-validations/</guid><description>Validating individual fields Advanced Forms uses ACF to render and validate fields. This means that any custom field validations will also work with your forms. ACF provides the acf/validate_value to add extra validation logic for specific fields and it&amp;rsquo;s the recommended way to add validation logic for form fields as well. Refer to the ACF documentation for more info.
Validating forms Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not sufficient to validate individual fields. From version 1.</description></item><item><title>Decreasing number of scripts and styles</title><link>/guides/decreasing-number-of-scripts-and-styles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/decreasing-number-of-scripts-and-styles/</guid><description>Advanced Custom Fields has the unfortunate habit of enqueuing scripts and styles for all field types even when not in use. As a result there are normally scripts and styles included when displaying a form which are not actually in use.
It&amp;rsquo;s possible to manually dequeue unecessary resources with a bit of care. The following snippet can be used to dequeue some things which are included by ACF. The comments explain which field types use which enqueues.</description></item><item><title>Displaying your form</title><link>/guides/displaying-your-form/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/displaying-your-form/</guid><description>Once a form has been added and fields have been assigned you can display the form either using a shortcode or with a function call.

The plugin comes with the ability to automatically save form data to entries and to send custom emails. Emails and entries can be configured in the form settings but are not enabled by default.
If you need to process the form data further the handy action hook af/form/submission should be used. To simplify the retrieval of field values a helper function af_get_field is provided which takes a field name/key and returns a value.</description></item><item><title>Using calculated fields</title><link>/guides/using-calculated-fields/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/guides/using-calculated-fields/</guid><description>Calculated fields are updated live when a form is filled out and can contain any content you&amp;rsquo;d like to. They are perfect for providing previews or to show calculated values before submission.
Adding a calculated field Calculated fields are just regular ACF fields. Go to your field group and add a new field of type &amp;ldquo;Calculated&amp;rdquo;. Next you need to configure what value this field should display which is done in the form settings.</description></item></channel></rss>
